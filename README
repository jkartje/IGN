Dear IGN,

I have created a simple Java GUI to display my reponses to the questions for the 
Code - Foo Challenge.  The main method is located within the Driver class.
My resume and the requested graph for solution 3 can also be found here in my
repository.  Thank you for taking the time to consider my submission and please
send me an email if there is any viewing/compatibility issues.

Thanks
